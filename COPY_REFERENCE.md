# Foundry Labs — Copy Strategy & Rewrite

---
---

## Copy Strategy

### Who we are
Two senior devs building an AI-focused agency. We offer engineering, AI systems, design, and marketing — all senior-led, craft-first.

### Target audience
- Non-tech founders who need technical execution
- SMBs and agencies wanting AI automation, modern web, and modernization

### Tone
Premium & confident. High-end studio feel. Not salesy, not corporate.

### Core messaging pillars
1. **AI-native, not bolted on** — we build AI into the architecture, not as an afterthought
2. **Senior craft** — two founders, hands-on, no juniors, no handoffs
3. **Full spectrum** — AI, engineering, design, marketing — one team
4. **Speed through leverage** — small team, modern tools, fast delivery
5. **AI ≠ cheap** — AI has a perception problem: people associate it with cutting corners, replacing humans, and not caring about quality. We want to flip that. We use AI to raise the bar, not lower the cost. AI in our hands means *more* precision, *more* craft, *faster* iteration — not less human judgment. The market is flooded with "AI-powered" agencies churning out generic slop. We're the opposite: AI lets us spend more time on the decisions that matter, not less.

### Narrative to develop (not on landing yet)
> The industry has trained people to think "AI = cheap and careless." Every auto-generated blog post, every generic chatbot, every "built with AI" stamp on mediocre work has eroded trust. We get it. But that's not what AI is in the right hands. When senior engineers use AI, it doesn't replace taste — it amplifies it. It doesn't skip the hard thinking — it clears the runway so you can do *more* of it. We're not using AI to do less. We're using it to do better.

## Recommended Copy (Section by Section)

Map to current components: NavBar → HeroSection → PhilosophySection → ServicesSection → Footer

---

### NavBar

- **Logo:** Foundry
- **Links:** Services | Approach | Contact
- **CTA:** "Start a Project"

> Rationale: "Start a Project" is more action-oriented than "Book a Consult." It signals you're ready to work, not just talk.

---

### HeroSection

**Option A (recommended):**
- **Heading:** "AI systems built with senior judgment."
- **Body:** "We help founders and growing companies integrate AI, build modern software, and ship — without the agency bloat. Just two senior engineers and a network of specialists."
- **Sign-off:** Iago & Diego

**Option B:**
- **Heading:** "Speed without sacrifice."
- **Body:** "A boutique studio that builds AI-native software for founders who care about craft. No juniors. No handoffs. No bloat."

**Option C:**
- **Heading:** "Your AI team. Two engineers. Zero overhead."
- **Body:** "We design and build AI systems, modern web experiences, and automation — directly, personally, and fast."

> Why A: It leads with the outcome (AI systems) and the differentiator (senior judgment) in one line. The body handles "who is this for" and "why us." B is punchier but less specific. C is the most direct but may feel too transactional for the premium tone.

---

### PhilosophySection

**Quote:**
> "AI-native, not bolted on. Boutique, not factory."

*(Keep as-is. This is the strongest line across all your copy. It does the work of an entire section in 8 words.)*

**Body:**
"We don't bolt a chatbot onto your existing mess. We redesign how your business works — then build the software to match. Every project is led by the founders, from architecture to deployment."

> Why this works: It speaks directly to the non-tech founder fear (someone will just slap AI on top), contrasts with the real approach (redesign first), and reinforces the founder-led promise.

**Alt body:**
"Most agencies add people to move faster. We use better architecture and smarter automation. The result is software that works harder — built by the people you actually talk to."

---

### ServicesSection

**Heading:** "What we build"
**Tagline:** "Systems over services."

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI Integration** | Custom LLM pipelines, autonomous agents, and intelligent automation — embedded into your business logic, not bolted on top. |
| **Software Architecture** | Scalable, maintainable systems for companies that need to build right the first time. From MVPs to production infrastructure. |
| **Web & Landing Pages** | High-performance, conversion-focused web experiences. Design, motion, and code — all in-house. |
| **Workflow Automation** | Replacing manual processes with intelligent systems that actually work. We connect your tools, eliminate busywork, and ship fast. |

> Notes: Dropped "Workflow Orchestration" (jargon). Dropped "unified symphony" and "data silos" (buzzwords). Each description now answers "what do I get?" in plain language. Added "Web & Landing Pages" because you mentioned design/marketing services.

---

### Footer / CTA Section

**Heading:** "Ready to build?"
**Subtext:** "Limited availability for Q1 2026."
**CTA:** "Start a Project" → mailto:contact@foundry.ar

**Footer details:**
- Studio: About | Services | Contact
- Connect: Twitter | LinkedIn | Email
- "© Foundry Labs 2026"
- "Crafted in Argentina"

> "Ready to build?" is direct and confident. The scarcity line (limited availability) adds urgency without being pushy.

---
---

## Copy to Discard

These lines from the variants should NOT be used — they're AI-generated filler that would undermine credibility:

- "Forge the future" — generic
- "Initiate Protocol →" — roleplay, not a CTA
- "Neural Architecture" / "Neural Engine: Online" / "Latency: 12ms" — fake technical theater
- "We architect the silent intelligence behind tomorrow's infrastructure" — says nothing
- "Fortune 500 retailer, 40% increase in cart size" — fabricated case study
- "S.F. — TOKYO — LONDON" — you're based in Argentina, not three cities
- "HELLO@FOUNDRY.SYS" — not a real email
- "Select Protocol" — aesthetic noise

---
---

## Copy Worth Saving for Later

These are strong lines from the original landing that don't fit the current 4-section page but could be used on an expanded site, about page, or case studies:

- "Most teams don't fail because of technology. They fail because of poor decisions upstream."
- "We operate like an internal strike team — not a vendor."
- "Decisions first. Software second."
- "Technology is a multiplier, not a replacement for judgment."
- The fit/not-a-fit qualifying list
- The engagement flow details (0→1, recovery, interventions) — good for a "How we work" subpage
- The 6 differentiators (senior from day one, clear ownership, etc.)
- "We're deeply involved in every engagement. If you talk to Foundry Labs, you talk to the people doing the work."
